# CanSource Meta-Repository

This repository contains information about CanSource itself. It's worth briefly noting that this
repository deliberately isn't the special `.github` repository just to keep concerns seperated.

CanSource is the "Canterbury Open Source Hardware Group," we're a small group of researchers and
designers based around Canterbury, New Zealand with the common goal of developing open source
hardware. Part of this goal is to provide excellent documentation for our open source hardware as
a way for people to learn more about electronics. This means documenting our design process and
not just the design itself.

CanSource is in its infancy in the moment. Please be patient whilst we grow :) We hope to setup
some guides to contributing soon.
