# CanSource Articles

Articles are one of the main outputs of CanSource and are published on our website 
[CanSource.org](https://cansource.org/). The purpose of most articles is to share information about
a particular project (e.g. the design process) but they may be about other areas of interest with
electronics and design being particular areas of interest. 

## Submitting an Article

Articles may be submitted by anyone as a pull-request through 
[the CanSource website repository](https://github.com/CanSource/website). Once submitted, articles
are reviewed by the website maintainers. If there are any issues with the article the submission may
be returned for the author to fix. Once the article is deemed satisfactory it will be published to
the website.

## Article Guidelines

Articles that are worthy of publishing on the CanSource website must be:

 1. Pertinent to electronics and design, or CanSource.
 2. Written in plain and concise English.
 3. Well formatted with no broken links, images, or equations.
